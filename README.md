# Reinforcement learning for legged robots

This is a crash course on applying reinforcement learning to train policies that balance real legged robots. We first review the necessary basics: partially-observable Markov decision processes, value functions, the goal of reinforcement learning. We then focus on policy optimization: REINFORCE, policy gradient and proximal policy optimization (PPO). After some practical advice on training with PPO, we finally focus on techniques to train real-robot policies from simulation data: domain randomization, simulation augmentation and reward shaping.
